# Nesta 0.9.4 released

I just pushed another version of the Nesta gem, which fixes an encoding
bug that is sometimes seen under Ruby 1.9 when running on Heroku. It was
[reported and fixed][bug] by Barry Keenan.

[bug]: https://github.com/gma/nesta/issues/closed#issue/14

I've also brightened up the colours of the links in the default theme.

Install it with `gem install nesta`.
